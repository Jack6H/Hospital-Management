## 1. Functions, Project Introduction and Effects of Services.jsx

Functions
Service list display:
Static listing of the main functions of the hospital management system, including:
Patient Management
Appointment Scheduling
Electronic Health Records (EHR)
Billing and Invoicing
Drug Inventory Management
Staff Management
Data Analysis (Reporting and Analytics)
Telemedicine Integration

Project Introduction
Positioning: Service introduction page, used to inform users about the functions provided by the system.
Technical implementation:
Build a static page using React. Use Tailwind CSS for simple layout styling. There is no dynamic data interaction, only rendering fixed content.

Effects
UI example:
```plaintext
Our Services
• Patient Management
• Appointment Scheduling
• Electronic Health Records
• Billing and Invoicing
•... (other service items)
```
Interaction:
A purely static page with no click events or form submissions. It is suitable as an overview page of system functions to guide users to specific functional modules.

### Code Structure:
- **Basic Layout**: Introduce the header and footer through the `<Layout>` component.
- **Content Structure**: Use a card-style layout (rounded corners + shadows) to list functions item by item, and pair with icons (such as `FaList`) to enhance recognition.

### Effects
1. **Visual Design**:
    - Medical-themed color scheme (primary color: blue, secondary colors: white/orange).
    - Each function item contains an icon and a title, which is simple and clear (for example, `FaUserGroup` corresponds to "Patient Management").
2. **Interactive Experience**:
    - The text "Appointment Scheduling" is clickable (or accompanied by an arrow icon) to prompt users to jump to the `Appointments.jsx` for operations.
    - Responsive layout: Stacked display on mobile devices and arranged in two or three columns on desktop devices.
3. **Function**:
    - Quickly convey the system capabilities and guide users to enter specific functional modules (such as appointment management).
