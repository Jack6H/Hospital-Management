HealthHub is a comprehensive React-based hospital management system designed to streamline healthcare operations and improve patient care. A comprehensive hospital management system is built using JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, and Font Awesome icon technology. It has a user-friendly responsive interface and enables functions such as appointment management, maintenance of patient records, management of doctor information, and provides management tools. The pages of the system include a homepage, an appointment page, a patient page, a doctor page, and an administrator page.
For the deployment, the backend is deployed at https://hospital-management-server-zeta.vercel.app/.
For users who want to install and use this system, the specific steps are as follows: Clone the repository: Use the command git clone https://github.com/yazdanhaider/Hospital-Management.git to clone the project repository to the local machine and obtain the source code of the system. Navigate to the project directory: Enter cd Hospital-Management in the command line to enter the directory where the project is located, getting ready for subsequent operations. Install dependencies: Execute the npm i command to automatically install all kinds of dependency packages required for the project to run, ensuring the integrity of the system functions. Run the development server: Start the development server by using the npm run dev command, allowing the system to run properly in the local environment, which is convenient for debugging and testing.
During the actual use, users can easily browse different parts of the system through the top navigation bar and quickly locate the required functional modules. They can use the appointment form to arrange new appointments, and the operation process is simple and clear. In the patient management section, operations such as adding, editing, and deleting patient records can be carried out to achieve dynamic management of patient information. In the doctor information section, relevant information of doctors can be viewed and managed to reasonably arrange the work of medical staff. Administrators can log in to the Admin panel using "admin" as both the username and password to access management functions and perform advanced management operations on the system.
